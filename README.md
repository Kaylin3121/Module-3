Website Type: Video Game 
Website Purpose and Goals: The purpose of my website is to let people try 
out games online. One goal that I have for my website is to make sure that 
the code works when I try to play one of the games as a way to test it 
out. Another goal that I have is to make sure the games are fun and 
exciting to my target audience. 

Feature Milestones: The main feature of my website are the video games 
themselves. 

Accessibility considerations: Adding descriptions for each game. Maybe 
text-to-speech.

Website Color Palette: My website color palette would be bright, bold and 
colorful so that when people go to the website they will be excited to 
look at a game they want to play. 

Layout Plan: My layout of my website would look a little bit similar to 
Youtube since I want the games to look small when people first go onto the 
website. Also, by small I mean the games would be in separate boxes. There 
would be different categories for the games on the side of the website via 
a drop down menu. 

Target Audience: My target audience would be teenagers, because they would 
like playing video games after their homework is done or after a long day 
at school. 

The Font: The font I might use would be generic. Nothing too flashy or 
fancy. 

Site Map: The map of my website would include a home button, a dropdown 
menu for the game categories.
